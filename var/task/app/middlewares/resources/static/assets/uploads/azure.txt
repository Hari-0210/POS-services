define cloud computing
	this is ability to rent cloud computing resources on demand
	only pay for what you use
	
Shared responsibility model
	This is the concept that u have certain responsibilities as a customer of cloud services and cloud 
	
	when service run on cloud
		not responsible for building security, physical network security and all
		becaus it running in cloud
		
		
	SaaS software as a service
		highest level of abstraction with cloud computing
		dont have access to os and  dont have access to application
		saas is renting access to  a software and u dont have code and u dont have control version
		if they going to upgrade feature or add some features and that is going to happen over periodwhere you are in not in control
		this is highest level of abstraction
		higher the abstraction kevel, lower your control
		
		
Public cloud
	it is computing service offered by third party provideers over the public internet
	making them available to anyone to purchase  or use them
	Azure owns the  hardware on their network and infrastructure
	
Private cloud
	it is computing service offered either over internet or a private internal  network and 
	only to select users intead of general public
	only available to selcted users
	it doesnt need to be fully on cloud
	looks and acts like a cloud 
	it is privately owned thing
	itcalled azure stack
	
Hybrid cloud
	its a combination of public and private
	
	
	
	
High availability
	Expressed as percentage it is a ability of a system to respond to users
	system is operational
	
	
Scalability
	The ability of  a system  to handle growth of users or work
	Scaling is ability to add capacity  to your application
		You do this through elasticity to eliminate this
		
Elasticity
	The ability of a system to automatically grow and shrink based on application demand
	the servers to acheive 100% after run and to add additional servers automatically and its called elasticity
	
Dual benefits of reliability and predictablity

Microsoft publishes Service Level Agreement SLA for their services

Security is a fulltime job

Identity is no 1 attack vector, identity protection is a key

Another attack vector called Distributed Daniel of Service DDoS

Cloud models
	Iaas
	Paas
	SaaS
	Serverless
	
IaaS
	Is a tye of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage and networking resources on demand pay as you go basis	
	This is the lowest level of service in the cloud
	VM, networking, load balancers, firewall
	
PaaS	(Next Level)
	is a complete develepoment and deployement environment in the cloud
	also called cloud native 
	like iaas , PaaS includes infrastructure- servers, storage and networking
	but also middleware, developement tools, business intelligence services, dbms 
	paas is designated to support complete web application lifecycle
	
SaaS
	allows users to connect to and use cloud based appsover the internet
	common examples are email,calendering and office tools
	
Serverless
	There are still servers
	you just dont ever have to deal with them
